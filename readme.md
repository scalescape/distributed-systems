# About

Are you interested in distributed systems, high scalability, bottlenecks, microservices, architecture, tools, and frameworks? If so, you are part of a community of like-minded tech enthusiasts where we discuss building distributed systems and the related concepts.

## **Frequency**

We catchup monthly over meet (or live at times in coffee shop) - **PST/PDT timezone**

> ðŸ“ŒÂ **Please share your email in [this form](https://forms.gle/yhgVCQaX8mBbVUj86) so we could invite you to the future events.**

### Interesting Problems

Some problems / theories are interesting and hard to solve and itâ€™s applicable to distributed systems and captures the essence of failures or ways we need to handle.

- **Byzantine General's Problem**
- Two generalâ€™s problem: [YT video by Tom scott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP-rGJKSZ3s&t=438s&ab_channel=TomScott)
- **Time synchronization**
- **Exactly Once**

If youâ€™re into papers, PapersWeLove have a great [list](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/main/distributed_systems/README.md), especially oneâ€™s by Leslie Lamport are great.
